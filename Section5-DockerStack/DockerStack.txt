Scenario
For container
    1. docker run <containerName> running each individual container
    2. have the docker-compose.yml and run docker-compose up will run all the containers

For swarm
    1. docker serice create <containerName> 
        - run multiple instances of each service
        - orchestrate their deployments with service and stacks
    2. have the docker-stack.yml and run docker stack deploy command to 
        - deploy the entire application stack all at once

container
1. is a packaged form of an application that
    - has its own dependencies and
    - runs in its own environment

service
1. has 1 or more instances of the same type container running on a single node or across multiple nodes

Docker Stack
1. is a group in inter-related services that together form an entire application
2. allows me to monitor each service separately
    - if each service requires additional capacity then I will expand the service alone
3. makes my application distributed and easy to scale/manage

docker-stack.yml
1. has the deploy property
    - deploy:
        replicas: <numberOfIntance>
        placement: 
            constraints: // act like condition
                - node.hostname == node1 // place the service under node 1
                - node.role == manager // place the service under manager node
        resources:
            limits: // ensure the service not drain the underlying OS
                cpus: 0.01
                memory: 50M

docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-stack.yml <stackName>
1. deploy the application
