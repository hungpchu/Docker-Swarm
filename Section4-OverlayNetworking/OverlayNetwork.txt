Docker Network
1. Bridge
    - private internal network created by docker on the host
    - all containers attached to this Network by default and
    - they get an internal IP address in the range 172.17.0.1
        - the container can access each other using this internal IP
    - if want to use this IP external then map port to the docker host's port

2. Host
    - takes out any network isolation between the docker host and the docker containers
    - can not run multiple containers on the same host on the same port as the porsts are common to all containers in the host network

3. None
    - container are not attached to any networks
    - does not have any access to the external network or other containers

Have multiple docker node/host
1. each has the own private internal network
2. How can container across the host/node communicate with each other from different host?
    - publish the port on those containers and 
    - set up routing
    - OR use overlay network

overlay network
1. docker network create --driver overly --subnet 10.0.9.0/24 my-overlay-network
    - will create an internal private networks that
        - spans across all the nodes participating in the swarm cluster
2. docker service create --replicas 2 --network my-overlay-network
    - attach the container/services to this network while creating a service

Ingress network
1. is a type of overlay network which
    - is a single network that spans across all the nodes in the clusters
2. load balancer
    - receives requests from any node in the cluster and
    - forwards the request to the instance on any other nodes
    - creating a routing mesh
        - helps in routing the user traffic that is received on a node that 
            - is not even running an instance to other nodes that are running
3. default behavior of docker swarm
    - don't have to do additional config

Scenario
1. Have a web server and a database running on the same node
    - How can I get web service to access the database on the database container?
        - use the internal IP address assigned to the database container
            - not ideal since the container have the same IP when the system reboots
        - use the container name
            - Docker has the built in DNS server that
                - holds the containers to resolve each other using the container name
                -DNS server runs at the address 127.0.0.11
