docker run <containerName> command
1. start the runnining container instance in a single docker host/node

Learn how to create swarm cluster
2. How do I utilize my cluster to run multiple container instances?
    1st way. run the docker run command above on each docker node/host
        - not ideal
        - should use docker swarm orchestration
    2nd way. docker swarm orchestration
        - key component is docker service

Docker Service
1. 1 or more instances of single application in container that
    - run across the swarm cluster
2. can create a docker service running multiple instances of my web application across workers node in my swamp cluster
    - run docker service create --replicas <numberOfInstances> <containerName> command on the manager node

docker service create --replicas <numberOfInstances> <containerName> 
1. when running this command in the manager node
    - the orchestrator on the manager node decides how many tasks to create and
    - the scheduler schedules that many tasks on each worker node
    - the task on the worker node
        - is 
            - the process that kick off the actual container instance
            - responsible for updating the status of the container to the manager node for
                - keep track of workers and instances running on them
        - has 1 to 1 relationship with each container
        - in case the container fail then task fail as well
        - when the task fail then node knows and create a new task

Replicas service
1. are created with --replicase option
2. may cause issue where some node can have multiple instances while other nodes may have none instance

Global service
1. are created with --mode global option
2. 1 instance per 1 node

docker service update --relicase <newNumberOfInstance> <containerName>

docker service ps <serviceName>/<serviceID>
1. see the task created by the service
